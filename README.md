PortAudio-OpenGL Waveform Drawer for Testing Audio Algorithms

History:
    I've built this for the purposes of testing my audio algorithms and seeing the waveform it produces. This only works on Mac OS X as of right now. 

    I'll be adding example audio algorithms as time goes by, feel free to use this waveform generator and any audio files I add.

How to install:

1.  Install brew. Go to this website to install -> http://brew.sh/
2.  Install portaudio. 
        -> brew install portaudio
